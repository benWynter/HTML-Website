      <p>
        Police drama about a veteran officer who escorts a rookie on his first
        day with the LAPD's tough inner-city narcotics unit. "Training Day" is a
        blistering action drama that asks the audience to decide what is
        necessary, what is heroic and what crosses the line in the harrowing
        gray zone of fighting urban crime. Does law-abiding law enforcement come
        at the expense of justice and public safety? If so, do we demand safe
        streets at any cost?

        In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level job at
        a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still in his
        20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his
        trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort
        makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions.
        However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a hedonistic brew of
        sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of
        excess.

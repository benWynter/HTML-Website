        Do you sometimes behave irrationally or impulsively? Do you face some
        situations with fear and trepidation? Do feelings of self-doubt consume
        everyday activities? Leading forensic psychologist, Dr Steve Peters,
        knows more than anyone how impulsive behaviour or nagging self-doubt can
        impact negatively on our professional and personal lives. In this, his
        first book, Steve shares his phenomenally successful mind management
        programme that has been used to help elite athletes and senior managers
        alike to conquer their fears and operate with greater control, focus and
        confidence. Seemingly complex concepts are made simple with the use of
        memorable analogies -- such as the 'chimp', that seemingly irrational
        and impulsive being that inhabits our minds -- and real-life case
        studies. Never before will you have had such a deep and clear
        understanding of your own behaviour and natural responses to certain
        people or situations. This knowledge, combined with simple techniques
        that can be easily incorporated into daily life, will help you to
        control your emotional impulses and reach your full potential, leading
        to success at work and a more harmonious home life.

      <li><h2>Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill</h2></li>

      <p>
        Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational
        Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?"
        The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now
        counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.The most famous
        of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a
        lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that
        forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in
        this one. In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill
        draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and
        other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In
        the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author,
        lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in
        applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how
        contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay
        Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth.
        Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to
        preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers.

      <p>
        Sherman McCoy, the central figure of Tom Wolfe's first novel, is a young
        investment banker with a fourteen-room apartment in Manhattan. When he
        is involved in a freak accident in the Bronx, prosecutors, politicians,
        the press, the police, the clergy, and assorted hustlers high and low
        close in on him, licking their chops and giving us a gargantuan helping
        of the human comedy, of New York in the 1980s, a city boiling over with
        racial and ethnic hostilities ...

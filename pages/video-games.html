        In December, 1988, two unlikely figures from the Yakuza world, Kazuma
        Kiryu of the Kanto region and Goro Majima of the Kansai Region, have
        suddenly found themselves getting involved in the terrible events of the
        so-called "Empty Lot" dispute, which is the centerpiece of power
        struggle for all the dark organizations across Japan. In order to find
        out the truth behind such a power struggle, as well as maintain their
        own innocence and safety, they set out to investigate all the events
        surrounding the "Vacant Lot" incident. In Kamurocho, Kiryu is suspected
        of murder after the man that he has collected money from winds up dead
        in a piece of real estate that is hotly contested. Kiryu's boss, Sohei
        Dojima, offers a promotion to second-in-command of the Dojima Family to
        whomever can find the deed to the land and thus the most ruthless
        members go after Kiryu. On the run, Kiryu must prove his innocence thus
        keeping his foster father from facing retribution for introducing him
        into the clan. In Osaka, Goro Majima runs a cabaret club after being
        exiled from the Tojo Clan due to the Ueno-Seiwa hit years earlier.
        Despite his club being highly successful, he realizes it's nothing more
        than cage as he's under constant surveillance. One day, he's offered the
        chance to redeem himself by assassinating a target. He takes the job,
        but can't go through with it when he realizes his target is in fact a
        defenseless blind girl. He decides to protect her instead and find out
        why she's being targeted.
